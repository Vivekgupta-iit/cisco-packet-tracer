## Project Description
This project showcases the design and configuration of three separate networks using Cisco Packet Tracer. Each network consists of multiple nodes, a router, and various servers such as an HTTP server, FTP server, and log server. Additionally, the project includes the implementation of several protocols to facilitate communication between different network elements.

Moreover, the project incorporates the setup of a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Cisco Packet CLI. The NIDS is responsible for monitoring network traffic, detecting potential security breaches or anomalies, and alerting network administrators in real-time.

## Network Topology
The project comprises the following network topologies:
1. Network A: Consists of nodes, a router, and servers. Implements basic network communication protocols.
2. Network B: Similar to Network A but with different configurations and additional servers.
3. Network C: More complex network setup with advanced configurations and the implementation of NIDS using Cisco Packet CLI.

The network topologies are visually represented using Cisco Packet Tracer and can be accessed within the project files.

## Implemented Features
1. Network A:
   - Node-to-node communication using IP addresses.
   - Configuration of a router to enable inter-network communication.
   - Setup of an HTTP server for serving web content.
   - Implementation of FTP server for file transfer.
   - Configuration of a log server for monitoring network logs.

2. Network B:
   - Similar features as Network A but with different IP addressing scheme and server configurations.

3. Network C:
   - Advanced network configuration with multiple nodes, routers, and servers.
   - Implementation of a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Cisco Packet CLI.
   - Configuration of NIDS rules and alerts for detecting network anomalies.
   - Monitoring and analysis of network traffic using NIDS.
